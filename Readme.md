# ZScriptified Legacy of Rust weapons

Requires GZDoom 4.12 and **id24res.wad** from Doom Rerelease

by Agent_Ash aka Jekyll Grim Payne

## What is this?

These are GZDoom versions of weapons from Legacy of Rust, a new campaign included with the Doom Rerelease.

**This mod DOES NOT INCLUDE SPRITES OR SOUNDS**. It only includes definitions for them, but you'll need to add **id24res.wad** from Doom Rerelease into your load order for them to work.

The only exception is customized muzzle flash sprites, which are modified from the ones that come with Legacy of Rust.

This mod is an exact mechanical replica, but NOT an exact visual replica of the weapons, because I wanted to add extra flair to them using ZScript.

## Contents

- **Incinerator** — Plasma Rifle replacement. The mod modifies its fire and projectile animations a bit, so there's less quick flickering between sprite frames, making the animation smoother. It also adds some particle effects and more nuanced muzzle flash animation with more sprite variations.

- **Heatwave Generator** — *not currently included*. Will be a BFG9000 replacement.
